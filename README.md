# Password-Generator

For this application I created a password generator that creates a password for the user at random. The app gives the user the options of using lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and/or numbers to generate the password. The criteria for the password must also include between 8-128 characters in order for password to be generated. Once the user confirms the type of password they want, a randomized password is created at random and is displayed in the password generator window.
